   <h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  Hi! I’m <strong>Harsh Tripathi</strong>, a web development enthusiast currently studying B.Tech at <em>Raj Kumar Goel Institute of Technology (AKTU)</em>, Ghaziabad.<br><br>
  I enjoy creating websites and learning new things about how the web works. I love writing clean code and building pages that look good and work well on all devices.<br><br>
  My goal is to become a skilled web developer and make websites that people enjoy using.<br><br>
  Recently, I joined a team where I’m learning and working with others to improve my skills and build great projects together.
